# Office Hour 21/10/2016 with Mathias Brandewinder (**@mathias**)

## F# Open Source Dugnad Day

This idea represents a worldwide community effort, happening twice a year, that would result in fixing/improving "core tools".

- People would meet IRL in a room (respectively in different meetup groups for instance).
- A 30-min starting presentation explaining everything necessary to start fixing tools.
- For those not available, due to not having a meetup group close to them, remote pairing would be available.
- The goal would be to fix a set of chosen tasks from a backlog/task list. Look at [chihacknight](https://github.com/chihacknight/breakout-groups) for some inspiration. 

> ***Proposal***: In order to structure this event, as there is still is a lot of work/thinking to do to make it work, it needs an **initiative circle**.
