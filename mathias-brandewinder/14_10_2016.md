# Office Hour 14/10/2016 with Mathias Brandewinder (**@mathias**)

## Project Hours

- They are like office hours but where he main subject is about a partiular project.

> ***Proposal***:  Invite 1 project maintainer to chat around about 1 project. Some kind of "Open Source AMA". Could even be some sort of Hangout office hours.

## Looking for a Volunteer

> It would be great to have a volunteer to drive the TryFsharp project.
