# Office Hour 19/10/2016 with Dave Thomas (**@7Sharp9**)

## Core engineering group

_What should be the state/role of core engineering group?_

- Show more scenarios where F# can be used.
- The CE group's role should be focused toward improving F# core aspects
  * For instance Type providers
  * As a Gitbook on TP (as a tutorial on how to create them) 

## Livecoding

Pairing on livestream would benefit in multiple aspects:

- Community involvment with "core tools"  
- Being to pair remotly i.e mutually help each other.
